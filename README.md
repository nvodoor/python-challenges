# python-challenges

This project involved creating four different programs to analyze data results from a csv or text file. One program - PyPoll - tabulated voting results. One project - PyBank - tabulated stock records. Another project - PyBoss - dealt with reformatting employee data, and then placing it in a new CSV. The final project - PyParagraph - involved analyzing text to get paragraph counts, word counts, sentence counts, and letter counts.
